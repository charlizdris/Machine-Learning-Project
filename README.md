# Machine-Learning-Project
Multi-class image classification of maritime vessels demonstrating the value of using PCA and Neural Networks. Machine Learning (STOR 565) final project at UNC-Chapel Hill.



Includes: 

Image Optimization - Resizing Images, converting them to greyscale to reduce dimensionality, edge detection

Image Augmentation - Flipping images based on x and y axis to create more data to work with

Neural Networks using full dimensionality (39675) with different drop out rates (poor results)

Neural Networks using data after PCA, kept 40 variables

Neural Networks using data after edge detection and PCA reduction.

The Neural Network using images that went through edge detection and PCA yielded a 85% correct classification rate
